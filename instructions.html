    <h1>Welcome to the Brassimulator!</h1>
    
    <p>Have you ever wanted to play your instrument but then realized you didn't have it? Oh no! Or did you learn you wanted to play a synthesizer, but you (actually this is me) can't actually play any other instruments?? Well, you're in luck; the Brassimulator is here to save the day! Now, you can simulate playing your instrument any time you want! (Unless you're on a device this doesn't work on, that's WIP)</p>
    
    <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This tool is helpful whenever you feel like playing/practicing songs on your instrment when you don't have it, but it could be particularly useful for learning new music and how it sounds.</li>
        <li>The sound is just a synthesizer that I put basic effects on to make it sound more brassy. I chose that because it was really easy to program; I might make it more realistic one day, but that'll take time to add.</li>
        <li>The pitches that are played are computed mathematically, so not every pitch will be perfectly in tune with the note that is visualized. Keep that in mind! (You can also use this to learn which partials do/don't center well.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>INSTRUMENTS:</h2>
    <p>Currently, only Mellophone (AKA the best instrument) is supported. Eventually, you'll get the opportunity to play others too.</p>
    
    <h2>HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What you'd normally play with your mouth, you now play with your mouse! Click or press space to play a note.</li>
        <li>The pitch of the note depends on the vertical position of your cursor. The background contains several different-colored regions; each of these represent a partial! Move your cursor up or down to change the partial you're currently playing.</li>
        <li>To change the fingering, press the keys J, K, and L on the keyboard (like real valves!). This will shift the regions of each partial down a certain amount, just like a regular horn would. This will make transitioning between fingerings feel a lot more realistic, but you can also disable it in settings if it's too challenging. If using your left hand to press the valves is more natural given the interface, you can also change that in settings.</li>
        <li>When you play a note, the note under the instrument will update to show what you're currently playing!</li>
        <li>Moving the cursor horizontally will adjust the dynamics! Left = quieter, right = louder.</li>
        <li>Right-click or press ALT/Option to play an accented note!</li>
        <li>View the "SETTINGS" panel to view some extra features you can control.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>FEATURES IN THE PIPELINE:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Visual reference of where exact notes are so it's easier to know where to put the mouse to play a specific note</li>
        <li>Valve slide functionality</li>
        <li>More instruments!!!</li>
    </ul>
